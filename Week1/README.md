## 1.1 Introduction to User Needs Assessment 

#### Why do a user need assessment? 

1. To understand why people would want to use a product or 

2. To learn how people actually use of didn't use a product or service 

3. To see what people like or dislike about a product or service 

4. To hear what else people might want from a product of service 

#### When to do a user needs assessment?

**Before any design phase**
- Before designing something new 
- Before a re-design

**Any time questions or problems arise**
- What causes users to want our service? 
- Why don't customers go beyond the home page? 
- What frustrates users of our product? 
- How could we improve the client's experience? 

**Origin of "need assessment"** 
- 1960s 
- Roger Kaufman, an educational technology researcher 

**In UX, "needs" = needs, wants, preferences**
- Often focused on a product or service 
- Pros and cons to taking a broader view

**Strengths of qualitative research**
- In-depth 
- Broad range 
- Hypothesis generation 
- Causal explanations 

Qualitative research is extremely good at uncovering ideas and concepts **in-depth**, often across a **broad range** of different used cases. And it's also useful for **generating hypotheses** about what users really want, and what they actually think about. Sometimes qualitative research is also used as a way to understand **causal explanations** from, let's say surveys. Where we might understand something about a given user population, but we don't know why they think that way. Qualitative research can be useful at understanding those kinds of issues.


## 1.2 Overview of Qualitative Research 


### Sales data? Survey? Usage statistics?

**Quantitative research helps to understand...** 
- Overall trends
- Existing product or service 
- Issues you can anticipate 

**Quantitative research is less useful for...** 
- Detailed understanding 
- New possibilities 
- Unanticipated issues

Now, of course this kind of data is useful as a way to understand overall trends about how users of the product use the product. Also it tells you something about the existing product in particular. In particular, all of the things that the designers of the system and the data that's collected could anticipate all of that will have been collected. 

On the other hand, this kind of quantitative data is not particularly useful as a way of really understanding in-depth how users actually use a product or what the new possibilities are for the product. So, as somebody who does user needs assessment, you would actually say actually I prefer to try a different kind of methodology for devising new features for the product.

### Mini-Project Assignment Handout
Throughout this course, you will be practicing skills within the context of a small user needs assessment project of your choice. For this assignment you will provide a description of the project and include the names of at least two interview candidates who are willing to be interviewed and observed. 

Product or Service

For the purposes of this course, a good project will be about an existing  product or service to which you and your interview participants have ready access. The product or service should be one that...

You and your interview participants have ready access to; 
Likely involves some problems or challenges during usage;
You are not yourself especially familiar with.
Products or services that might be appropriate include websites, apps, toys, tools, online services, in-person services, and so on. Examples include Amazon’s website, WhatsApp, a Rubik’s cube, a lawn mower, your local Department of Motor Vehicles website, the line at the local post office, etc. 

Scope 

You will need to choose an appropriate scope for your project. Scoping is not easy to get right, but think of it in terms of something that you would be able to investigate to some depth in hour-long interviews with two different people. As noted in the videos, you are not likely to be able to do a meaningful user needs assessment of Amazon’s entire website with just two interviews. At the other end, Amazon’s one-click check-out would probably not be meaningful to spend an hour on. However, a couple of interviews would be enough to understand some things about the basic check-out process when purchasing items from Amazon. 

If you have doubts about your scope, you may want to post your idea in the Discussion forum to receive feedback.

Description and Question

Your project description should about one or two paragraphs in length. It should provide basic background into the overall product or service, as well as the specific aspect that you will focus on for your user needs assessment. For this assignment, you should think of something that may cause its users some degree of difficulty. You should also phrase the focus of your study in terms of a question such as, “What causes trouble for users of Amazon’s basic check-out process?” 

The project description does not need to be long, but it should provide a basic description of the product or service (for people who may not be familiar with it) along with a good sense for the scope of the issue you are investigating. 

You will also be asked in a separate prompt to indicate what type of difficulty you suspect users may have with the product or service. 

Interview Participants

Part of this assignment requires you to line up at least two interview participants. They should each be…

Current (or recent) users of the product or service that your user needs assessment will be about.
Willing to be individually available for an interview and observation session that lasts between 60-120 minutes sometime over the next couple of weeks (while you are taking the course).
Someone you are not too familiar with. In particular, avoid family members or good friends, as the experience of interviewing relative strangers is one that you should have. 
In the prompts for this assignment, you will be asked to list these two people, their relationship to you, and to attest that they have agreed to an interview with you. 

If you can line up more than two interview participants, that’s terrific! It will give you more opportunity to practice.
